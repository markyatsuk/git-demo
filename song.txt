While seasons flow into one another
It’s getting so hard to remember
Those memories I don’t even have
All the summer romances we never had
Every dance I never danced with her
What we’ve never been through together

She’s a woman and so much more
She’s a woman

I got so many pictures on my walls
Dad asking : « when is she coming home ? »
He doesn’t know she doesn’t know me at all
Sometimes, I wish I could be a decade older
And wave these years goodbye to be with her
So she could turn me into a better man
